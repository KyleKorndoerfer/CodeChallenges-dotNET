# Fizz Buzz Plus Machine #

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 (same as a standard
FizzBuzz machine), but...

numbers that are exact multiples of 3,
__or__ that contain 3, must print a string containing "Fizz"

	   For example 9 -> "...Fizz..."
	   For example 31 -> "...Fizz..."

numbers that are exact multiples of 5, 
__or__ that contain 5, must print a string containing "Buzz"

	   For example 10 -> "...Buzz..."
	   For example 51 -> "...Buzz..."
